# vanilla-reddit

This project is an exercise in recreating a complex ui using only html / css / vanilla js.

Reddit is an absolutely massive site so I only recreated portions of the homepage, with the intent being on replicating the user expereience as closely as possible.

## Limitations

Because reddit does not make their assets publicly accessible (outside of using their official api), I had to rely on simplying copying assets that I needed for the UI (icons/etc.) or recreating them from freely accesible - a notable example are the post images, which are randomly generated from https://picsum.photos.
